                                                    allowed for both learning and creativity. I now have a portfolio of
                                                    artwork that I&apos;m really proud of. I highly recommend this class
                                                    to
                                                    anyone looking to improve their drawing and coloring skills.</p>

                                                <p>The PTT class at GIFA was an amazing experience! The instructor was
                                                    very
                                                    knowledgeable and provided excellent guidance throughout the course.
                                                    I
                                                    started as a complete beginner, and by the end, I was able to create
                                                    detailed and colorful drawings. The hands-on practice sessions were
                                                    incredibly helpful, and I loved exploring different coloring
                                                    techniques.
                                                    Highly recommend!</p>
